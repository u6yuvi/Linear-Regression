# Linear-Regression

Background 

A bank wants to understand how customer banking habits contribute to revenues and profitability. The bank has customer age and bank account information, e.g., whether the customer has a savings account, whether the customer has received bank loans, and other indicators of account activity. 


The Task 

We want to build a model that allows the bank to predict profitability for a given customer. A surrogate for customer profitability available in our data set is the Total Revenue a customer generates through their accounts and transactions. The resulting model will be used to forecast bank revenues and guide the bank in future marketing campaigns.
